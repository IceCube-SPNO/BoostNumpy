Release Notes
=============

2014-07-15 version 0.1.1

    - Replaced BOOST_PP_LOCAL_ITERATE by BOOST_PP_REPEAT in order to allow gcc
      4.8.2 to compile with boost 1.54 without huge memory leaks and segfaults.
      This improves also the compilation with clang 3.4.0, although here it's
      not that dramaticlly.

2014-03-24 version 0.1.0

    - Initial release.
    - Implemented unit tests.
    - Still poor documentation.
